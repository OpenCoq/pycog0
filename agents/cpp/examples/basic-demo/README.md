# Basic Agent-Zero Demo

This example demonstrates the basic structure and concepts of the Agent-Zero OpenCog integration.

## Overview

This demo shows how Agent-Zero integrates with OpenCog's cognitive architecture to create a coherent agent system.

## Components Demonstrated

- Basic cognitive loop implementation
- AtomSpace integration for knowledge representation
- Simple perception-action cycle
- Goal management and task decomposition

## Building and Running

```bash
# From the agents/cpp directory
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make basic-demo
./examples/basic-demo/basic-demo
```

## Expected Output

The demo will show:
1. Agent initialization with OpenCog integration
2. Basic cognitive loop execution  
3. Sample perception and action cycles
4. AtomSpace operations and knowledge updates

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - This demo will be implemented as part of task **AZ-DEMO-001**.

See [AGENT-ZERO-GENESIS.md](../../../../AGENT-ZERO-GENESIS.md) for the complete development roadmap.
