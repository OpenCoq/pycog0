# Agent-Zero Core Module

This module implements the core orchestration engine for Agent-Zero integrated with OpenCog.

## Overview

The Agent-Zero Core provides the main cognitive loop and orchestration capabilities that integrate deeply with OpenCog's cognitive architecture. It serves as the foundation for all other Agent-Zero components.

## Key Components

- **AgentZeroCore**: Main agent orchestration class
- **CognitiveLoop**: Implements perception-action-reflection cycle
- **TaskManager**: Manages goal decomposition and execution  
- **KnowledgeIntegrator**: Bridges with AtomSpace knowledge representation

## Dependencies

- cogutil
- atomspace  
- cogserver

## Build Instructions

This module is built as part of the overall Agent-Zero system. See the root CMakeLists.txt for build configuration.

## Integration Points

### AtomSpace Integration
- All agent state represented as Atoms
- Knowledge structures use standard AtomSpace types
- Goal hierarchies represented as structured Atoms

### CogServer Integration  
- Agent runs as CogServer module
- Exposes agent state through CogServer commands
- Supports real-time monitoring and debugging

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - This is part of the Agent-Zero-Genesis initiative.

See [AGENT-ZERO-GENESIS.md](../../../AGENT-ZERO-GENESIS.md) for the complete development roadmap.
